post,1bj482i,Best time to hop in,osef82,1710905922.0,4,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1bj482i/best_time_to_hop_in/,Please help a beginner. When is the best time to hop in to defi? Let’s say in to liquidity farming. Is it when the market has lower value? Or best day was yesterday? Should I wait more for market lows?,
comment,1bj482i,,monkeyhold99,1710907044.0,5,,,The best time is during high volume times because that’s when LPs generate the most revenue from fee swaps. The risk with that is impermanent loss.,kvoqbs5

comment,1bj482i,,Old-Dragonfruit1,1710969461.0,1,,,Providing liquidity is not the same as buying and holding a token and waiting for it to go up.  When you provide liquidity you put up your tokens and users of that platform will swap their tokens for yours.  Each time someone swaps they pay a fee and you earn by collecting these fees.  So there is no best time in terms of market highs or lows.  But you do make more fees when there are more people wanting to swap the tokens in the pool.  There are plenty of tutorials and videos that you can watch to get a better understanding of it.,kvslmwi

comment,1bj482i,,Zealousideal_Error47,1710928794.0,1,,,Be aware that this cycle could be different from the previous crypto cycles. BTC has already reachd all time highs in contrast to 2020 and 2016. This are my opinions but BTC could drop down to 50K before going up after halving happens.,kvplgjj
