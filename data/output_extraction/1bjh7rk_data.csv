post,1bjh7rk,USDV stablecoin - is it trustworthy?,prepinakos,1710951058.0,0,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1bjh7rk/usdv_stablecoin_is_it_trustworthy/,"I have recently discovered this stablecoin and I am thinking about investing in some liquidity pools containing USDV.

On their website they mention that evry USDV is overcollateralized by underlying token STBT ( ERC-1400 standard token for accredited investors to access ‘risk-free’ short-term US Treasury securities with maturities within 6-month, and overnight reverse repurchase agreements.) 

All sounds good but has anyone digged deeper and found any flaws or risks?",

comment,1bjh7rk,,moo9001,1710975610.0,1,,,The obvious risk is the involvement of the US regulators (Gary) making the collateral token worthless.,kvt3gz4
comment,1bjh7rk,,prepinakos,1710951473.0,1,,,what do you mean by credit based investing? based on USDV description it seems much safer than USDC or USDT which we got basically no idea what they are backed by and if they are backed enough,kvr2x2p
